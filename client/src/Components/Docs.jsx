                    directors you've watched without any filter options.
                    However, the sorting options give you a convenient way to
                    index these directors and rearrange them in several ways:

                    This search bar allows you to search for a director by their

                    happens because we are directly querrying for results from

                    You can rate a film by giving it either 1, 2, or 3 stars. A
                    useful guide would be to think of it in terms of Michelin
                    stars. In order for a restaurant to get just one star, it
                    must have been delivering distinctly rich flavors and
                    creating a wonderful culinary experience for its customers.
                    In this line of thought, one can watch a lot of films
                    throughout their lifetime but reserve the stars only for
                    films they consider most impactful. The criteria for each
                    star is entirely left to the user's imagination, but below

                      nothing'), whereas strong feelings call for a change in
                      the status quo. This rating system tries to mimic the same
                      behavior. Most of us wouldn't go out of our way to rate a
                      film 3/10. But if we experienced a memorable film, why not
                      encapsulate those emotions with a star encoded with

                        for curatorial purposes. For example, it will be quite
                        challenging to consistently distinguish between a 5/10
                        (2.5/5) and 6/10 (3/5) film--and there are little usage
                        to this categorization even if one manages to do it

                    rating it, but any film that is rated will automatically be
                    marked as watched. Unrating a rated film will not affect its

                        &nbsp;The maximum final score, {"\\(S\\)"}, for each
                        director is 10. This is achieved by adding a rating
                        score and a watch score together, which respectively
                        weighs 60% and 40%.

                        <GoSquareFill className="text-lg inline" />
                        The rating score, {"\\(f(a)\\)"}, is simply the average
                        star-rating that a director has (maximum 3.0), which
                        gets multiplied by 2 to make up maximum 6/10 of the
                        final score. If a director has no rated film, their
                        rating score defaults to 0.

                        The watch score, {"\\(f(b)\\)"}, was created based on
                        this scenario: You've only seen one film from a new
                        director and decided to give it 3 stars. If we simply
                        calculate the average rating and convert it to a scale
                        of 10, this director gets a 10/10. Meanwhile, your
                        favorite director of all time has made a lot of 3-star
                        films, but also had a couple 1-star or 2-star films.
                        Their average rating is something like 2.4/3, which
                        translates to an 8/10. How can your favorite director of
                        all time score lower than a director who you'd just
                        discovered?

                      In a way, the watch score is like a membership card that
                      gets more holes punched the more you revisit a store. It
                      rewards a director for how often you go to them for a good
                      cinematic experience. By the time you've watched the 9th
                      film from the same director, it seems safe to assume that
                      they've earned your utmost loyalty--and therefore earning
                      the maximum 'reward' possible.

                          &nbsp;In order to calculate the watch score, we first
                          feed the number of films user has watched by a target

                        &nbsp;This function aims to give directors with 1-3
                        watched films a very quick jumpstart, provide a linear
                        ascend for those with 4-6 watched films, slowly level
                        out the curve for those with 7-9 watched films, and
                        finally cap the score at 1 for those who've had 9+
                        watched films. Multiplying the result of this function
                        by 4, we derive a maximum 4/10 for the watch score. This
                        distribution addresses two problems.

                          above can be avoided: your all-time favorite director
                          will most likely score higher than others despite
                          having made a couple non-perfect films.

                          to penalize a director for having too few watched
                          films (the initial jumpstart), nor overcompensate them
                          for having lots of watched films (the maximum cap).

                        &nbsp; Filmmaking is not equally easy for directors
                        around the world, whether it comes to starting a
                        production, or getting their work to the audience. Those
                        who are established will be likely to have more of their
                        films watched, whereas those who are just starting out
                        will have fewer to showcase. In avoiding a linear slope,
                        our goal is to even out the playing field for these two
                        groups. Your go-to director might get ranked top, but an
                        excellent budding filmmaker will not get left far behind
                        either.

                        time, is a film that was made half a century before it.
                        This may speak to the low level of attention that
                        non-Hollywood cinema has on voting platforms like TMDB.
                        A film can be an important cultural phenomenon for a

                        enjoyers in the first place. India was picked as an
                        example because it's a country with a huge population
                        that does not seem adequately represented in TMDB's

                      &nbsp;This Venn diagram is a demonstration of an imagined,
                      but not entirely impossible scenario. Let's say that all
                      film watchers around the world are divided into three
                      types: those who only watch U.S. films, those who only
                      watch Indian films, and those who only watch films from
                      neither countries above. At the intersection of these
                      three group is an orange region that represents film
                      watchers who indiscriminately watch films from all the
                      regions mentioned.

                      from TMDB who'd casted a vote in the past (assuming all
                      TMDB voters are film watchers). It is necessary for this
                      region to take this shape because we cannot assume all
                      watchers of films around the world has voted on TMDB, nor
                      can we assume TMDB voters intersect with certain groups
                      but not others (e.g. what if some TMDB voters only watch
                      Indian films, or some only watch films that are from the
                      U.S. and other countries, etc.)

                      blue region forms the subset of TMDB voters who also
                      indiscriminately watch films around the world, which is
                      colored in green. Finally, the inflated portion of the
                      star-shaped region, which is colored in red, represents a
                      subset of TMDB voters who exclusively watches films from
                      the United States.

                      data--indeed, it seems extreme to imagine a group of
                      people who refuse to watch films from anywhere outside of
                      the U.S. However, the purpose of staging this scenario is
                      to ask the question: what if the majority of voters on
                      TMDB only watch films from very specific regions? Wouldn't
                      the preferences of those belonging to the red region
                      overshadow the preferences of those inside the green
                      region? And how would that affect the representation of
                      films watched by people outside of the red region?

                      &nbsp;The dominance of English-language films on TMDB is
                      simply striking. There are 89 distinct original languages
                      in the database, and English alone takes up more than 70%.
                      This number does not seem to match with the very first
                      graph that we started with, where countries like India,
                      Japan, China, are among the most prolific anual producers
                      of feature films. A huge linguistic bias, combined with a
                      high possibility of bias in the voting demographics (who
                      also happens to speak the most dominant language), creates
                      the elephant in the room for The Film Atlas.

                    The Movies Databse is by no means perfect, but it is an
                    extremely comprehensive database, where one will find most
                    films that they need to. And even when they don't, there's
                    the freedom to add entries for films they cannot find.

                    Knowing its flaws, we still decided to use The Movies
                    Database because of its potentials. The Film Atlas, in a
                    nutshell, is using a biased database to try and counter the
                    effects of its own biases.

                  <div className="">
                    <a>Phase Two</a> of The Film Atlas involves creating our own
                    film database on a more granular level (think cities instead
                    of countries). This will give us a lot more room to
                    experiment and develop an archive system that is less prone
                    to biases.

                    In the mean time, for the users, this might mean that the
                    vote count and/or average rating will have to be lowered for
                    films from less prominent regions for them to show up in
                    Discover Mode on the Map Page.
