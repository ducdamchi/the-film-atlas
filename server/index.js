/* Notes:
db.sequelize.sync() synchronizes Sequelize models with database tables by either:
- Create tables that don't exist in database
- Alter tables to match model definitions, or
- Drops and recreates tables.
.then() is a Promise that resolves when the synchronization is complete. Since sync() returns a Promise, we can use .then() to execute code after the sync operation finishes.
